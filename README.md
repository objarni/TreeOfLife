# What is Tree Of Life?

Tree of Life is an experiment in visualizing your life on the really big scale; the scale of months and periods of your life.

Why would this be helpful?

Well it has helped me get unstuck and see where I am at now in life. Just getting that 'birds eye' perspective of you life, makes it easier to see what is important for you. At least it was for me!
